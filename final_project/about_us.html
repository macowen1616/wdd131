            <h3>Who we are</h3>
            <p>
                    6mm Airsoft was founded by a group of passionate airsoft enthusiasts who wanted to create an exciting 
					and realistic battlefield experience in the Greater Northern Nevada area. We believe airsoft is more than just a game—it’s about teamwork, 
					strategy, and the thrill of immersive military-style gameplay. That’s why we built Rusty’s Junkyard, our custom-designed airsoft field that 
					blends urban and industrial environments for dynamic, fast-paced action.
					Our mission is to provide a safe, fun, and competitive environment for players of all skill levels, 
					from beginners learning the ropes to experienced operators looking for a tactical challenge. Whether you're here for weekend skirmishes, large-scale events, 
					or private matches, we’re committed to delivering top-tier airsoft experiences with well-organized gameplay, high-quality rental gear, 
					and a strong community of players who share a love for the sport.

            <p>
                At Rusty’s Junkyard, gameplay is built around immersive military-style scenarios that challenge players to think tactically,
			work as a team, and adapt to high-intensity situations. Our field’s urban-industrial design creates the perfect setting for objective-based missions, 
			such as hostage rescues, search-and-destroy operations, and territory control. Players will need to utilize cover, 
			coordinate movements, and execute strategic assaults to complete their missions successfully. 
			Whether you’re breaching buildings, defending key positions, or engaging in fast-paced firefights, every match at 6mm Airsoft delivers an adrenaline-fueled 
			experience that puts your skills to the test. Our focus on realistic combat simulations makes Rusty’s Junkyard 
			the ultimate battleground for airsoft enthusiasts looking to elevate their game.

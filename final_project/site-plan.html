			<p>Description:	Rusty’s Junkyard is a high-intensity urban-industrial battlefield designed for immersive military-style combat. 
				Set in an abandoned scrapyard filled with rusted vehicles, shipping containers, and makeshift barricades, 
				this dynamic warzone demands tactical precision and teamwork. Navigate through tight alleyways, breach fortified buildings,

				and demolition ops, where every move could mean victory or defeat. With a mix of CQB (Close-Quarters Battle) zones and open firefight areas, 
				Rusty’s Junkyard challenges players to adapt, strategize, and dominate in fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled skirmishes. 
				Gear up, lock in, and prepare for battle—only the best will survive.</p>
